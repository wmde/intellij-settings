# IntelliJ settings

Settings for IntelliJ based IDEs, currently only holding a PHP codestyle.

## Using the settings

This repository mirrors the structure of the IntelliJ settings directory.

To use all or some settings from this repository, copy the needed files from this repo to your
IDEs settings directory. Conversely, to add new settings to this project, copy them from your
IDEs settings directory to the corresponding place in this git repo.

Example location of the settings directory on Kubuntu:

    ~/.PhpStorm2017.2/config
    
You can find the directory via the IDE itself by opening File -> Import Settings, which should
select the settings directory. (The import/export functionality does not work with this git repo.)
